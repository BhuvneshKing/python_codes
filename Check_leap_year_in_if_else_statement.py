A normal year has 365 days. Every four years, however, there is a leap year with 366 days. This is because the earth does not need exactly 365 days to travel once around the sun, but about a quarter day more. So a year has one day more every 4 years.

So that the calculation is correct, there is no leap year every 100 years. Nevertheless, every four hundred years a leap year takes place. This concerns the years 2000, 2400 etc.
